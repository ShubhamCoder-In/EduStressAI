# EduStressAI – Samadhan 2.0 Hackathon Submission (Round 1)

**Project Idea:**
EduStressAI is designed to analyze and manage stress levels in students by leveraging AI and data-driven approaches. The project provides personalized insights and recommendations to help students improve their academic and personal well-being.

**Hackathon:**
**Samadhan 2.0 – Round 1 Submission**
*This repository is created to clearly communicate our project to the judging panel of Samadhan 2.0 and demonstrate our organized approach, teamwork, and timely completion of all assigned tasks.*

**Team Members:**

* Shubham Garg
* Ronak Sharma
* Rozi Chilwal

All team members contributed equally to the development and research of this project.

## Project Overview

EduStressAI is a comprehensive solution built as part of the Samadhan 2.0 Hackathon. In this round, we proposed our AI model approach and demonstrated its working. The repository contains multiple mini-tasks assigned by the Hackathon team, all completed within the given time limit.

The project integrates several mini-tasks to analyze student behavior, detect stress patterns, and provide actionable recommendations using AI models. This round focused on showcasing our model's capabilities and feasibility.

**Key Features:**

* AI model to analyze student data and detect stress levels
* AI-driven recommendations for stress management
* User-friendly interface for data input and results
* Completion of multiple Hackathon-assigned mini-tasks within the time limit:

  * Data preprocessing and cleaning
  * Model building and evaluation
  * Frontend UI for interactive analysis
  * Backend APIs for data handling
