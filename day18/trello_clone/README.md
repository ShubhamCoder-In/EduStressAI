# Trello-like Project Skeleton

This repository skeleton was generated by `create_trello_clone_project_structure.py`.

## Structure
- backend/: Express + MongoDB backend skeleton
- frontend/: React frontend skeleton (placeholder files)

## How to use
1. Backend:
   - `cd backend`
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run dev` (if you installed nodemon) or `npm start`
2. Frontend:
   - `cd frontend`
   - `npm install`
   - `npm start`

This is a starter scaffold to speed up development. Replace placeholder code with your app logic.
